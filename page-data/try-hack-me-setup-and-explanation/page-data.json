So during a pretty rainy and tedious afternoon around last September I decided to give it a go. I setup my account and started looking for interesting boxes to play with. </p>\n<p>Eventually I found something I liked and jump right in, but before doing it I decided documenting a pretty simple step-by-step of how I usually setup my environment before playing with the boxes. </p>\n<h2>Quick setup</h2>\n<p>Normally I start by getting the machine’s name and adding it to my <code class=\"language-text\">/etc/hosts</code> so I don’t have worry which IP address I’m currently dealing with. You can get this to work by doing:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ sudo vim /etc/hosts</code></pre></div>\n<p>As a result, you might get something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># The following lines are desirable for IPv4 capable hosts\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n10.10.129.210   tartarus.thm\n\n# 127.0.1.1 is often used for the FQDN of the machine\n127.0.1.1       mylocalhost  thishost\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nff02::1         ip6-allnodes\nff02::2         ip6-allrouters</code></pre></div>\n<p>Noticed how I added the <code class=\"language-text\">10.10.129.210</code> followed by <code class=\"language-text\">tartarus.thm</code>. I usually add the <code class=\"language-text\">thm</code> indicating its a TryHackMe machine, but you can do whatever you want. This should get your local DNS set. You can test it by <em>pinging</em> the host directly:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ ping -c 3  tartarus.thm\n\nPING tartarus.thm (10.10.129.210): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 87.123.248.80: icmp_seq=0 ttl=60 time=18.299 ms\n64 bytes from 87.123.248.80: icmp_seq=1 ttl=60 time=17.306 ms\n64 bytes from 87.123.248.80: icmp_seq=2 ttl=60 time=11.631 ms\n\n3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the response you get looks like this, it means its working. Otherwise, make sure you have your VPN up and running as this might be the case. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TryHackMe - Setup and explanation","date":"September 28, 2020","description":"Setting up TryHackMe vpn"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/try-hack-me-setup-and-explanation/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/try-hack-me-tartarus/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"TryHackMe - Tartarus CTF Writeup"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1144988516","2841359383"]}
